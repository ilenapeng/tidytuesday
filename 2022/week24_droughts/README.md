# Mapping the percentage of U.S. states in a drought - again!

Last fall, when I was first starting to do TidyTuesday, I made this [proportional area cartogram heatmap](https://github.com/ilenapeng/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week30_droughts) of the percentage of each U.S. state in a drought.

## The original chart

It was fun, but left a lot to be desired. In the original image, I positioned the rings on top of each other, so the weren't quite nested, and both the legends were a bit difficult to read. Doing the final finishing touches in Adobe Photoshop also made this hard to replicate.

So when I saw the same dataset again in TidyTuesday for 2022, I thought I would recreate my original chart. One key change that made life easier: This time, I exported as an SVG and used Illustrator to align everything the way I wanted it.

And one more thing that I still wish was better: I would have liked to make the chart titles and subtitles clearer in these charts. It was hard for me to decipher what the percentages meant - percent of population, percent of area, etc. - so more changes on that might still be coming soon.

## The replica

Replicating this chart was pretty straight-forward. I did use the source data from U.S. Drought Monitor though, instead of using the data provided by TidyTuesday, because it was more recent.

## A new?! chart
When I had made this circular one originally, I went back and forth about what symbol should be used. At first they were nested flames, but because they were too cluttered, I did nested circles instead. Last time, I couldn't decide between nested circles or squares, so this time, I decided to do both. I think the squares ended up being more legible.

## Wet conditions

TidyTuesday also had data on wet conditions - and not just drought conditions, so I thought I would create charts of the precent of states that were experiencing unusually wet conditions as well. I used the data provided by TidyTuesday for this, not the source US Drought Monitor data.
